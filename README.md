* Live weather info and forecasts for next 9 hours (openweathermap)
* Agenda to show what is on your shedule (from your iCalendar/s)
* RSS feeds from various providers to keep up to date with news, quotes etc.

## Hardware required
* 7.5" 3-Colour E-Paper Display (Black, White, Red/Yellow) with driver hat from [waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/product/7.5inch-e-paper-hat-b.htm)
**or**
* 7.5" 2-Colour E-Paper Display (Black, White) with driver hat from [waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/product/7.5inch-e-paper-hat.htm)
* Raspberry Pi Zero WH (with headers) (no soldering iron required)
* Or: Raspberry Pi Zero W. In this case, you'll need to solder 2x20 pin GPIO headers yourself
* MicroSD card (min. 4GB)
* MicroUSB cable (for power)
* Something to be used as a case (e.g. a RIBBA photo-frame or a 3D-printed case)

# Setup
## Getting the Raspberry Pi Zero W ready
1. After [flashing Raspbian Buster (with Desktop)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), set up Wifi on the Raspberry Pi Zero W by copying the file [**wpa_supplicant.conf**](https://github.com/aceisace/Inky-Calendar/blob/installer/wpa_supplicant.conf) (from above) to the /boot directory and adding your Wifi details in that file.
2. Create a simple text document named **ssh** in the boot directory to enable ssh. 
3. Install the SD card and boot your Raspberry Pi. Connect to it over the network with ssh and login. 
3. Expand the filesystem in the Terminal with **`sudo raspi-config --expand-rootfs`**
4. Enable SPI by entering **`sudo sed -i s/#dtparam=spi=on/dtparam=spi=on/ /boot/config.txt`** in the Terminal
5. Set the correct timezone with **`sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata`**, selecting the correct continent and then the capital of your country.
6. Reboot to apply changes
7. Optional: If you want to disable the on-board leds of the Raspberry, follow these instructions: 
**[Disable on-board-led](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/controlling-pwr-act-leds-raspberry-pi)**

## Installing required packages for python 3.x
Execute the following command in the Terminal to install all required packages. Please use Raspbian Buster with Desktop (preferably the latest version). Raspbian Buster **LITE** is not supported.

**`bash -c "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aceisace/Inky-Calendar/master/Installer.sh)"`**

**Installing tagged versions**: 
If you want to install a different version than the *master* branch, insert the tag name into the above URL, e. g.
`bash -c "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aceisace/Inky-Calendar/v1.7.1/Installer.sh)"`

**Upgrading from old versions:**:
If you were using a previous version, please use the web-ui for generating a new settings file. Settings files from previous versions are not compatible.

If you get some red lines, please run `pip3 install Pillow==6.2.0`.

If the installer is broken, please follow the instructions here [manual installation](https://github.com/aceisace/Inky-Calendar/wiki/Manual-installation)

If the Installer should fail for any reason, kindly open an issue and paste the error. Thanks.

## Adding details to the program
When you run the installer, you can add details in the last step. For new-users, it is recommended to use the 'web-UI' option.

You can also manually edit the settings file like this: `nano /home/$USER/Inky-Calendar/settings/settings.py`

Once your details are added, run the software with: `python3 /home/$USER/Inky-Calendar/modules/inkycal.py`. If everything is working correctly, you'll see some lines being printed on the console (not red ones). Lastly, the E-Paper display will show a fresh image.

If you encounter any issues, please leave a comment in the issues or via email. Thanks in advance.

## iCalendar
With the latest release (v1.7), most iCalendars (Google, Yahoo, etc.) will work without problems. With Google and Yahoo, recurring events are now supported as well. With the other iCalendar providers, testing has not been done.

Event names will be truncated until they fit in their allocated space/line. Try avoiding too long event names.

If you encounter errors related to your iCalendar, please feel free to report the error either by opening an issue or by sending a mail.

## Updating
Before updating, re-name the current Inky-Calendar folder e.g. Inky-Calendar-old and then run the installer again (see above), choosing the **update** option.

## Running Inky-Calendar manually and as service
$ python3 modules/inkycal.py
$ service supervisor start Inky-Calendar

## Setting up VS Code Remote development in WSL
In order to speed up development, most development tasks (apart from the actual rending to E-Ink display) can be developed on more powerful machines and in richer environments than running this on a Pi zero. In case of Windows PC the most convenient way is to use VS Code Remote development in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), please follow [Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote-tutorials/wsl/getting-started). 

To disable the eInk functionality set the flag to "image_only" (in /settings/settings.py):

`render_target = "image_only"`
